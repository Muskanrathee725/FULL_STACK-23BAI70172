************************************************************************Project Report: Weather Application************************************************************************8

This document provides a high-level overview of the Spring Boot-based weather application.

Project Structure
The repository is organized as a monolithic web application. The backend logic and frontend user interface are both contained within a single Spring Boot project.

src/main/java: Contains the Java-based backend logic (controllers and application entry point).

src/main/resources: Contains the frontend UI (HTML/CSS), templates, and the application configuration.

Backend Details (src/main/java)
The backend is responsible for handling user requests, fetching data from the external weather API, and serving the web pages.

Language: Java 21 (as seen in your logs)

Core Framework: Spring Boot 3.3.1

Build Tool: Apache Maven

Primary Responsibilities:

Serving the static HTML/CSS pages to the user.

Handling the form submission (POST request) with the city name.

Sending an HTTP request to the OpenWeatherMap API.

Parsing the incoming JSON response to extract weather data.

Passing the data model to the frontend (Thymeleaf) for rendering.

Key Libraries & Dependencies:

Spring Web: For creating REST controllers and running the embedded Apache Tomcat server.

Spring Boot Starter Thymeleaf: A server-side template engine to dynamically insert Java data into the HTML.

Spring Boot DevTools: For automatic application restarts and live reloads during development.

RestTemplate (or WebClient): Used to make the external API call to OpenWeatherMap.

Frontend Details (src/main/resources)
The frontend provides the user interface for searching for weather and displaying the results.

Core Technologies: HTML5, CSS3

Template Engine: Thymeleaf

Primary Responsibilities:

Displaying the initial search page (index.html).

Sending the city name to the backend via an HTML <form>.

Displaying the results page (weather.html).

Using Thymeleaf expressions (e.g., th:text="${temperature}") to dynamically show the weather data received from the backend.

Key Files:

/templates/index.html: The home page with the city search form.

/templates/weather.html: The template used to display the weather results card.

/static/css/: Contains the stylesheets for the application's appearance.

/static/images/: Contains icons (like the sun) used in the weather card.

application.properties: The configuration file that stores the secret API key for OpenWeatherMap.
